# Batch-File-Security
Open-source code for adding to your file. When you compile your file to .exe it serves the purpouse of a captcha, a password security tool and more!
Password for the preview files: passwdxd
If you encounter bugs let me know in the Issues tab
The file preview.exe is the first version
I try to update file preview.bat as often as i can


# HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY AKA DA ULTIMATE GUIDE TO BATCH SAFETY:
1. DOWNLOAD THE DESIRED CODE FROM MAIN CODE.TXT - YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE CODE,
	YOU CAN DOWNLOAD SPECIFIC PARTS TOO AND MIX IT UP AS YOU WILL, BUT IT'S BEST TO
	PLACE THE CAPTCHA BEFORE THE PASSWORD MODULE.
2. NOW PLACE THE CODE BEFORE YOUR FILE. THERE ARE COMMENTS IN THE CODE SO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH EACH PART :)
3. BUT DO NOT LEAVE IT IN THE BATCH FORM! ANYONE WHO HAS AT LEAST SOME KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROGRAMMING WILL EDIT THE FILE
		AND CUT ALL OF THE SECURITY MEASURES FROM IT! USE A BAT TO EXE CONVERTER (I HIGLY RECOMMEND THE ONES THAT ALLOW
		REDISTRIBUTION OF YOUR FILES ACCROSS DIFFRENT COMPUTERS.
4. NO ONE CAN NOW DELETE/BYPASS THE SECURITY MEASURES. BRUTEFORCING/DICTIONARY ATTACKING (CRACKING) THE PASSWORD
		WOULD TAKE AGES AND EVEN THEN THE CRACKER WOULD ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THE CAPTCHA THING.
5. BUT EVEN THEN, THE CODE IS NOT PERFECT AND A REALLY SKILLED HACKER COULD DE-COMPILE THE EXE FILE.
		I TRY TO REGULARLY UPDATE THE CODE WITH NEW FEATURES TO KEEP YOU FILES SAFE, SO YOU SHOULD CHACK THE REP OUT
		FROM TIME TO TIME :D


# The goals of this software
My goal in making this code was to make batch files more secure.
Also i'm kinda board right now so yea i made this from pure boredom.
But the 3rd goal is to help you learn batch coding. Not only that it's open-source and licensed with The Unilicense but it also has comments on each part of code. You can use them to build your own creations like this, maybe i'll inspire you to make someting cool? If something seems inclear tho, use the "something was unclear" issue template and notify me about this.
